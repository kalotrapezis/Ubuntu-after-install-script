# Ubuntu-after-install-script
This is a script I made so I can install all the stuff i need after installing Ubuntu in one go
it uses the dialog program to display a text based UI easy to understand and navigate.
to run the script give it permissions with the "chmod" comad 

sudo chmod 777 ubuntu-fix

and then run it with

./ubuntu-fix 

after that it will ask for your password.
soon after you will be able to see a set of instractions.
