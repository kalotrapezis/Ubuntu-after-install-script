# Ubuntu-after-install-script
This is a script I made so I can install all the stuff i need after installing Ubuntu in one go
it uses the dialog program to display a text based UI easy to understand and navigate.
to run the script give it permissions with the "chmod" comad 

sudo chmod 777 ubuntu.fix
sudo chmod 777 ubuntu.fix2


and then run it with

sh ubuntu.fix
afrer reboot
sh ubuntu.fix2

after that it will ask for your password.
soon after you will be able to see a set of instractions.
